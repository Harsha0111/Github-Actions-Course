What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions allows you to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying code directly from your repository.
Workflows are defined in YAML files and triggered by specific events, such as pushing code or opening a pull request.


The on key specifies the event that triggers the workflow. In this case, it will run when code is pushed to the main branch.
The jobs section defines a job called say-hello, which runs on an Ubuntu runner (ubuntu-latest).
The steps section defines the tasks for this job. Here, the only step is to run the command echo "Hello, World!".

After creating the hello-world.yml file, commit and push it to your repository.
GitHub Actions will automatically detect the workflow and run it on the next push.

Youâ€™ve already printed "Hello, World!" using echo. 
You can run other shell commands or even call scripts stored in your repository.
